Things left to do

- Reorganize data presentation (vague but many things to do, to be precised)
- prevent the description of photos when none on gallery
- Write a script to add contributors from a file containing student list (such a file added in setup directory)
- Change search form to avoid manual input.
- Resize and reorganize search form to make more space for the map
- Add a map in Location tab of a house
- Present informations on rooms
- Present student contacts (infos on contributors) 
- URL containing the name of the house instead of the id
- Https with certificate ?
- bigger thumbnail for search page
- add "price per person" automagically computed for the database (because it is the relevant criterion for search)
- Fix the update process after login (update button not working in "account")
- input errors feedback for the update forms
- Add update time in model (or dealt with promo of contributor ?)

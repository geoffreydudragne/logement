Things left to do

- Reorganize data presentation (vague but many things to do, to be precised)
- Improve the gallery transition (white flash)
- Fix the rendering of the description of photos on the gallery (and prevent it when null)
- Write a script to add contributors from a file containing student list (such a file added in setup directory)
- Change search form to avoid manual input.
- Resize and reorganize search form to make more space for the map
